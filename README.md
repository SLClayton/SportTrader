# SportTrader

SportTrader is a project that finds arbitrage sports bets that can guarantee profit by continuously searching odds on multiple betting exchanges to find varying prices.

The project was somewhat successful and can did find some profit. However the margins were very tight in a highly competetive market with low volumes that quickly diminished. The type of activity on the marktets was also not seen too kindly by the exchange admins with the request/profit ratio.
